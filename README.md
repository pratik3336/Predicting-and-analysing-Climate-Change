# Predicting-and-analysing-Climate-Change
Performed analysis of the major factors(greenhouse emissions, fossil fuel and industrial, agriculture and forest burning) contributing to global warming and carbon dioxide emissions.

# Global Warming Factors Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project dives into an in-depth analysis of the principal factors contributing to global warming and the rise in carbon dioxide emissions, with a particular focus on the COP26 (United Nations Climate Change Conference) discussions. By examining greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel consumption, industrial activities, agricultural practices, and forest burning, we aim to understand their collective impact on our planet's climate system over the past 270 years.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Collection**: Aggregated a comprehensive dataset spanning 270 years, encompassing critical variables such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions.
- **Time-Series Prediction**: Applied advanced forecasting techniques to predict future trends of significant pollutants contributing to global warming.
- **Impact Visualization**: Developed visualizations to illustrate the effects of various factors on forest cover and global surface temperatures.
- **Statistical Modeling and Prediction**: Utilized LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), and SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average) models to forecast global surface temperature and sea-level rise in the forthcoming years.

## Objectives

- To analyze historical data and identify major contributors to global warming and increased CO2 levels.
- To predict future trends in greenhouse gas emissions and their potential impact on the environment.
- To provide actionable insights for policymakers and environmentalists based on data-driven analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Time-Series Analysis: ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM
- Data Visualization
- Data Collection
